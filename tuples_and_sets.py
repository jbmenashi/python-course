tuple1 = (1, 2, 3, 4) # its a list with parenthesis, and it's IMMUTABLE!!!!
# tuples are faster than lists, so if you know it's not gonna change use it
tuple1[0] # 1
tuple1[3] # 4

#can be used as keys in dictionaries
# iterating is the same

set1 = set({1, 2, 3, 4, 5})

# no duplicates, no indexes, no keys, no values
# iterating is the same

#good way to remove duplicates
